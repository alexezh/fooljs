The current focus on fooljs is perform arithmetic computation using a human like patterns. Such as combining terms which produce nice round values first. 
The goal is not to build a solver, but to develop a framework for recursive a* search with modelling

Generalizing compute
- first we find that first + last or every second makes easy compute - which is first plus last, 
- then we represent it as (1 + x) + (2 + x-1) = 2*d ?
- now we need to jump that 2 is 4/2 ??
